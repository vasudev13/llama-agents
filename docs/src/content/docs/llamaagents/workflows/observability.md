Observability is key for debugging workflows. Beyond just adding `print()` statements, `workflows` ship with an extensive instrumentation system that tracks the input and output of every workflow step.

Furthermore, you can leverage this instrumentation system to add observability to any function outside of workflow steps! More in-depth examples for all of this information can be found in the [examples folder for observability](https://github.com/run-llama/llama-agents/tree/main/examples/observability).

## Observing step state with internal events

Beyond the events your steps emit, the runtime publishes internal events describing its own
execution. They are filtered out of `stream_events()` by default. Pass `expose_internal=True` to see
them:

```python
from workflows.events import StepStateChanged, StepState

handler = workflow.run()
async for ev in handler.stream_events(expose_internal=True):
    if isinstance(ev, StepStateChanged):
        print(ev.name, ev.step_state, ev.worker_id)
```

`StepStateChanged` fires whenever a step execution changes state. Its `step_state` is one of
`StepState.PREPARING` (enqueued, waiting for a worker slot), `StepState.RUNNING` (executing), or
`StepState.NOT_RUNNING` (finished). It also carries `name`, `worker_id`, `input_event_name`, and
`output_event_name`. It fires once per step execution, so a `@step(num_workers=N)` step or a fan-out
emits one event per item.

The [durable workflows](/python/llamaagents/workflows/durable_workflows) checkpoint loop uses this
event to snapshot after step executions finish.

## OpenTelemetry Integration

Workflows integrate with OpenTelemetry for exporting traces. Install the `llama-index-observability-otel` package:

```bash
pip install llama-index-observability-otel
```

Then configure it in your application:

```python
from llama_index.observability.otel import LlamaIndexOpenTelemetry

# Initialize with your span exporter
instrumentor = LlamaIndexOpenTelemetry(
    span_exporter=your_span_exporter,
    service_name_or_resource="your_service_name",
)

# Start registering traces
instrumentor.start_registering()
```

All workflow steps, LLM calls, and custom events are automatically captured and exported as OpenTelemetry spans with detailed attributes including:
- Span names for each workflow step
- Start and end times
- Event attributes (input data, output data, etc.)
- Nested span relationships showing execution flow

## Third-Party Observability Tools

Workflows integrate seamlessly with popular observability platforms:

### Arize Phoenix

![Arize Phoenix](./assets/arize.png)

[Arize Phoenix](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/integrations/frameworks/llamaindex/llamaindex-workflows-tracing) provides real-time tracing and visualization for your workflows.

You can read more in the [example notebook.](https://github.com/run-llama/llama-agents/blob/main/examples/observability/workflows_observablitiy_arize_phoenix.ipynb)

### Langfuse

[Langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse) directly integrates with the instrumentation system that ships with workflows.

You can read more in the [example notebook.](https://github.com/run-llama/llama-agents/blob/main/examples/observability/workflows_observablitiy_langfuse.ipynb)

### Opik

[Opik](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik) can receive workflow traces through the same OpenTelemetry pipeline used by workflows.

To configure export to Opik, use the OpenTelemetry setup above and point your exporter to Opik's OTLP endpoint. See the [Opik OpenTelemetry Python SDK guide](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/integrations/opentelemetry-python-sdk).

## Custom Spans and Events

You can define custom spans and events using the LlamaIndex dispatcher to add fine-grained tracing to your code:

```python
from llama_index_instrumentation import get_dispatcher
from llama_index_instrumentation.base import BaseEvent

dispatcher = get_dispatcher()

# Define custom events
class ExampleEvent(BaseEvent):
    data: str

class AnotherExampleEvent(BaseEvent):
    print_statement: str

# Use the @dispatcher.span decorator
@dispatcher.span
def example_fn(data: str) -> None:
    dispatcher.event(ExampleEvent(data=data))
    s = "This are example string data: " + data
    dispatcher.event(AnotherExampleEvent(print_statement=s))
    print(s)
```

When you call instrumented functions, all spans and events are automatically captured by any configured tracing backend.
