# llama-index-workflows

## 2.22.2

### Patch Changes

- 8be81d5: Reloading a failed workflow no longer crashes when the failure exception can't be rebuilt.
- 0dff2cc: Fix crashes during ctx.store edits when state holds non-deepcopyable objects

## 2.22.1

### Patch Changes

- 36fffec: Keep implicit waiters distinct across parallel workflow fan-out branches.

## 2.22.0

### Minor Changes

- cb89120: Add `list[E]` fan-out returns and `list[E]` fan-in joins.
- fd223e8: Steps can declare multiple single-event parameters to fire once when one of each has arrived.
- aee5fda: Add typed runtime step identities.

### Patch Changes

- 34e166c: Fix idle checks racing buffered events and stale `ctx.collect_events()` firings.
- 5724404: Preserve retry state for in-progress workflow steps across serialized context resume.
- 58e0174: Fix ctx.store.get() returning bound dict methods instead of stored values for state keys named items, keys, values, or get

## 2.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 9a4dd16: Add optional `allowed_types` and `allow_unknown_types` parameters to `JsonSerializer` to support type allowlisting during deserialization
- db1258b: Support opt-in subclass event routing via the step decorator parameter `accept_event_subclasses`
- 070fc70: State reads are lockless and read-committed on all backends; edit_state edits an isolated copy committed on block exit.
- 070fc70: Decode workflow state by payload shape instead of persisted type metadata, and make state-store runtime handoff explicit.

### Patch Changes

- 41e354a: Seed retry jitter with the run id during snapshot tick replay so rebuilt snapshots match the live run, and consume old-format delayed-retry journal entries instead of duplicating them
- 41e354a: Fix delayed retries being lost when a workflow is snapshotted or idle-released during the retry delay window

## 2.20.0

### Minor Changes

- 9bf247a: Add replay_ticks_stream and ReplayResult to surface the last exit-indicating command from tick replay
- 2cc9fae: Add `@catch_error` handler (supports `for_steps=[...]` and `max_recoveries`) and `Context.retry_info()` for handling exhausted step retries inline. `retry_info().last_exception` and `StepFailedEvent.exception` are live Python exceptions.

## 2.19.1

### Patch Changes

- f7e037e: Stream ticks during resume so peak memory is bounded by batch size rather than total tick history.

## 2.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 2592c80: Add composable retry primitives (`retry_policy(retry=..., wait=..., stop=...)`, `retry_if_exception_type`, `wait_exponential`, `stop_after_attempt`, etc.).

## 2.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 43ff242: Add `Context.get_step_context()` static method to retrieve the step context without a `ctx` parameter in the step signature

- 05f5f4e: Fix idle detection only working for wait_for_event, not for steps waiting on InputRequiredEvent
- 96e437e: Move task execution into the runtime, for maximal control of specific runtime semantics around determinism

## 2.15.0-rc.1

### Patch Changes

## 2.14.1

### Patch Changes

- 6ece797: Fix concurrent step cancellation regression where StopEvent no longer cancelled as quickly as previously

## 2.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 73c1254: refactor: expand runtime plugin architecture

  - Refactoring to better support alternate distributed backends
  - Some `Context` methods may now raise errors if used in an unexpected context
  - `WorkflowHandler` is no longer a future. Retains compatibility methods for main use cases (exception, cancel, etc)

- 45e7614: Replace InMemoryStateStore types with a corresponding StateStore protocol
- 2900f58: Support state type inheritance in workflows

### Patch Changes

- 45e7614: Refact: make control loop more deterministic

  - Switches out the asyncio delay mechanism for a pull-with-timeout that is more deterministic friendly
  - Adds a priority queue of delayed tasks
  - Switches out the misc firing /spawning of async tasks to a more rigorous pattern where tasks are only created in the main loop, and gathered in one location. This makes the concurrency more straightforward to reason about

- ebaf212: Add resource validation to workflow.validate()

## 2.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 6dd7fc0: Add resource config node support to workflow representation
- be19869: Add support for injecting resources more flexibly

  - Add support for injecting Resources recursively, so a Resource can depend on another Resource or ResourceConfig
  - Add support for injecting ResourceConfig directly into steps
  - Fix issues with resolving from String quoted types

## 2.12.2

### Patch Changes

- bfbfba4: Return an empty list for empty target events, rather than None
- 85f948e: fix: rebuild_state_from_ticks clears in_progress before replaying

  Fixed ctx.to_dict() failing with "Worker X not found in in_progress" when checkpointing resumed workflows. The function now also rewinds in progress when recreating from ticks, to match the actual behavior when resuming a workflow.
