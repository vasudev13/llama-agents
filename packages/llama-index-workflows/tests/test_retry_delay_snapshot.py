"""Snapshot/resume during a retry-delay window.

A workflow snapshotted between a failed attempt and its delayed retry must
round-trip: the delayed attempt lives in BrokerState (queued with an absolute
``not_before``), so the resumed run re-arms the delay and completes. Without
that, the retry existed only in the runner's in-memory wakeup heap and the
resumed run would hang.
